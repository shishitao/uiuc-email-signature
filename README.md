This repository contains an HTML-based email signature template designed to comply with the [UIUC Email Signature Guidelines](https://brand.illinois.edu/applying-the-brand/email-signature). It allows you to easily create a professional, branded email signature by simply copying and editing the source code.

Hereâ€™s an example of how your email signature will look once rendered:

## How to Use

1. **Copy and Paste HTML Code**
   - Open `main.html` in your favorite HTML editor.
   - For those who are not familiar with HTML, you can use an online HTML editor like [htmlcodeeditor.com](https://htmlcodeeditor.com/) to paste and preview the code. You can also edit it directly in your own IDE or code editor.

2. **Edit the Signature**
   - Replace the placeholder text with your own information (e.g., name, title, phone number, etc.).
   - Change the links (social media, website, etc.) to your own.
   - Delete any elements that are not relevant to your signature (such as social media icons or job titles).

3. **Copy and Paste Into Your Email Client**
   - If your email service allows HTML signatures, simply copy the HTML code and paste it into the signature section of your email client.
   - If HTML insertion is not supported, you can copy and paste the rendered preview (the final appearance of the signature).

## Features

- **Professional Formatting**: The signature template follows the official UIUC brand guidelines for email signatures.
- **Responsive Design**: The email signature is designed to look great on all devices.
- **UIUC Blue GitHub Icon**: The signature includes the GitHub icon styled with UIUC's blue color.
- **Customizable**: You can easily replace text, links, and icons to personalize the signature.

## Why Use HTML for Email Signatures?

- **Precision**: Using HTML allows for greater control over styles (e.g., font size, text color, icon size) compared to using plain text or an image.
- **Version Control**: You can easily track changes and updates to your email signature with Git.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that your signature looks the same across all email clients and devices.

## Why Host the Icon Online?

- **Bypass Image Blockers**: Hosting the icon online prevents issues with email clients that block embedded images.
- **Faster Load Time**: When hosted online, the image is served from a remote server, reducing email size and improving load times.
